# Linear Regression Using Boston Housing Data Set

This is a very quick run-through of some basic statistical concepts, adapted from Lab 4 in Harvard's CS109 course. 

#### 1. Linear Regression Models

#### 2. Prediction using linear regression
Linear regression is used to model and predict continuous outcomes with normal random errors. There are nearly an infinite number of different types of regression models and each regression model is typically defined by the distribution of the prediction errors (called "residuals") of the type of data. Logistic regression is used to model binary outcomes whereas Poisson regression is used to predict counts. 

In this exercise, you will see some examples of linear regression as well as Train-test splits.

#### The packages covered: statsmodels, seaborn, and scikit-learn, statsmodels and seaborn
